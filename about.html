            <h2>Who are the members of Arctic Monkeys?</h2>
            <p>Currently, the Arctic Monkeys members are Alex Turner, Jamie Cook, Matt Helders and Nick O'Malley.</p>
            <p>Alex provides lead vocals and rhythmic guitar, along with the occasional stint on keyboard and percussion. Jamie provides lead guitar, along with keyboard and backing vocals, Matt plays the drums and provides backing vocals, whilst Nick plays bass and also provides occasional backing vocals.</p>
            <p>Former member Andy Nicholson, who played the bass guitar, was in the band for four years, spanning from 2002-2006.</p>
            <h2>When did the band start?</h1>
            <p>Arctic Monkeys started back in 2002, as an instrumental only group. Alex and Matt, who were close friends and neighbours at the time, teamed up with their pal Andy to form the group. After the addition of Jamie, the Arctic Monkeys played their first official gig in 2003 and soon began recording demo tracks.</p>
            <h2>Where are they from?</h2>
            <p>The Arctic Monkeys are from Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. The band’s first ever gig in 2003 was at a pub in Sheffield City Centre called The Grapes.</p>
            <h2>How did Arctic Monkeys become famous?</h2>
            <p>The Arctic Monkeys began to gain popularity as they handed out CDs, containing their 18 demo tracks, at various gigs. The group also gained quite the following on the social media platform MySpace, and are now described as one of the first bands to come to the public’s attention through the Internet.</p>
            <p>The band’s large following on MySpace aided them in the promotion of their debut EP 'Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys', which was released in 2005. Following on from this - when performing on the Carling Stage, reserved for unsigned/less known bands, at both Reading and Leeds Festivals, the gang attracted an unusually large crowd.</p>
            <p>In their early days, Arctic Monkeys would attend, and often play support, at fellow Sheffield band Milburn's gigs. Many fans have since drawn comparisons between the two bands' music, claiming there is a striking similarity between their chords and lyrics.</p>
